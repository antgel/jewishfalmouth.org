Title: Echoes of 1800s Jewry in an unexpected corner of the UK

# Who am I and what is this?

I am a Jew with connections to the UK (born) and Israel (home).
In January 2018, I booked tickets to go back to the UK in
October 2018 to see some of my favourite bands, family, and friends.

I originally planned to visit London. As the time got nearer, I was
notified that my company would close for the week before my trip due
to the [Sukkot (Tabernacles)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot)
holiday. I took advantage and moved my outbound flight to a
week earlier.

In a classic first world problems scenario, what to do with this extra
time abroad? As someone who'd like to see more of the planet, I decided
to visit a part of the UK that I'd never been to before. namely
[Cornwall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall), a large county in
the South West of England, boasting the best weather in the country,
and specifically
[Falmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falmouth,_Cornwall), a town on
the south coast, known for history, sailing, art and culture.

# Story

After some days enjoying the delights of Falmouth, I noticed a Hebrew
signature in the corner of a photograph [^1] whilst browsing in
the window of [Cornwall Art Galleries](https://cornwallartgalleries.com/).
This was unexpected to say the least. (If I knew then what I know now,
I'd have taken a better photo.)

![Assaf Frank artwork]({lightbox}town/assaf-frank.jpg)

It's fascinating how Israelis get around, for a country with a
population of eight million people. I can barely spend time in
London without hearing Hebrew on the street, even once in the queue
at Primark Watford! (I don't shop there any more, the quality is
pathetic. ;))

But in sleepy Falmouth? I had to find out more. I went into the gallery
and spoke to the lady behind the counter. I explained what caught my
eye, and she told me that Assaf (Frank) is indeed an Israeli artist, and:

> "You're a tourist? Did you know that there is an old Jewish cemetery
> on the edge of town, by the Sainsbury's?"

Of course I didn't, and my curiosity was piqued. I'm not a history buff,
and the most I know about the history of UK Jews is that for much of the
last thousand years we variously hid our light under a bushel [^2], and
were persecuted and expelled, until the [1800s
emancipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_Kingdom)
when life started to look up. Conversely, from the early part of the
20th century, life started to look down for European Jews, many of whom
(such as my great-grandparents) made their way to the UK in search of
not a better life, rather any life.

And yet, Falmouth? Today's UK Jews are almost entirely city-based,
foregoing the beauty and wonder of the UK countryside for some kind of
safety in numbers. We congregate in a handful of London suburbs, and
even smaller areas of Manchester, Leeds, and other places that it
doesn't seem rational to live in.

As you can tell from the above, I'm of
[Ashkenazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews) origin, hence
it's pretty normal to ruin a delightful holiday with a visit to a
disused cemetery that time forgot.

I opened Google Maps and started walking.

# Cemetery

Around 2.5km and half an hour later, I'd found the Sainsbury's
supermarket, with a small industrial estate next door. I came across an
overgrown area with a locked gate, beyond which were some graves! Yay!

Upon closer inspection, there was a sign on the gate saying that the
[Dissenters Burying Ground](#dissenters) was closed, essentially due to
vandalism and probably-futile attempts to restore and maintain the area.
It can't be easy to raise money for restoration of cemeteries of
religious separatist groups...

Not knowing anything about Dissenters except that they weren't Jews, I
turned around and asked in the industrial estate. No clues. But I
couldn't give up. There was a small area between the Dissenters cemetery
and a new housing development on the other side, but I couldn't get
in to see if that was the holy grail.

I walked back out onto Falmouth Road to see if I could get in another
way. I found this entrance which backed onto the same area, and the
climb was easier. I was in.

## Entrance

Having essentially broken into a cemetery, going up the stairs was
easy. They were in historical or bad shape, depending on whether your
glass is half-full or half-empty.

![Cemetery entrance]({lightbox}cemetery/entrance.jpg)
![Cemetery stairs up]({lightbox}cemetery/stairs-1.jpg)
![Cemetery stairs down]({lightbox}cemetery/stairs-2.jpg)

I found myself in the other side of the Dissenters Cemetery, and over to
my right, past a crumbling wall, more graves! This was looking "good".

## Corner and side views

Cemeteries are strange creations, a relic of a time when most
people were convinced that there had to be some greater force at work.
And yet, why not honour our loved ones? It would take a brave person to
suggest that we start treating mortal human remains in the same way that
we treat any others. Which is why it hit me.

My excitement at connecting with this historical byline was tempered by
a dark, sombre mood as the heartbreaking neglect, vandalism, and disrepair,
came into focus. Cemeteries in London and Israel are generally in good
shape and implicitly reflect the idea that we live forever. This was real,
and nature will win in the end.

## Closer views

Unlike modern-day UK Jewish headstones, many of these were exclusively
written in Hebrew.

## Individual graves

Everything is so eroded, it's hard to make much out. Barry Hyman and
David Liss contributed some better photos (did they clean the
headstones?) to the corresponding page on [Cemetery
Scribes](http://www.cemeteryscribes.com/showmap.php?cemeteryID=61) [^3],
which also mentions Keith Pearce's book [The Lost Jews of
Cornwall](https://www.bookdepository.com/Lost-Jews-Cornwall-Keith-Pearce/9781900178273)
which even includes information on who are buried there.

## Dissenters

The [Dissenters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Dissenters)
cemetery is in just as much disrepair, plus trees which have grown in
amongst the graves in the 80 years since being abandoned.  The
[Wikipedia entry on the
cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregationalist_Cemetery,_Ponsharden)
has good, if sobering information on the entire site.

# Synagogue

As one does, I'd been searching the web whilst I was in the
cemetery. Reading about the Falmouth Jewish community, I noticed that
there had been a synagogue in Falmouth. I wasn't going to leave the area
without completing the jigsaw.

I headed for Gyllyng Street, close to where I'd been staying. I started
at the west end, and there was no sign of the distinctive, isolated red
building. Having asked locals who didn't know, I arrived at
the eastern end of the street [^4] and... nothing. Disheartened,
I carried on walking to the nearby (excellent) [Jacob's Ladder
Inn](http://www.thejacobsladderinn.co.uk/) for a refreshing beverage. 

A few metres later, as I reached Vernon Place, the continuation of
Gyllyng Street, lo and behold, there she was.

Google Streetmaps does the job again:

If the windows hadn't given it away, the sign did the job.

![Synagogue sign]({lightbox}synagogue/sign.jpg)

Now called Summerhill Studios. Falmouth is full of arty types, and with
these windows, it wouldn't surprise me if this was a place of
creativity. I knocked, but there was nobody home.

![Synagogue door]({lightbox}synagogue/door.jpg)

Beautiful, yet stark. They don't make them like this anymore.

# Conclusion

Looking at this panorama, the wonderful Airbnb where I'd been staying,
with its harbour views, is the grey house at the far left. The former
synagogue is the red building on the far right.

![Synagogue panorama]({lightbox}synagogue/panorama.jpg)

According to the
[Wikipedia entry on the
synagogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falmouth_Synagogue):

> Its commanding location, with a fine view of Falmouth harbour, is said
> to have been so that Jewish merchants could observe their ships
> entering and leaving the harbour.

After all that searching, it was right under my nose, we had the same
view. I can hear my superstitious Ashkenazi forebears saying this
whole unplanned saga was "beshert", Yiddish for "destined".  For me,
it's simply a reflection of the wandering nature of the somehow-enduring
Jewish people, and a reminder to make the most of now.

![Harbour view]({lightbox}town/harbour-view.jpg)

It turned out to be a great idea to visit this lovely part of the world,
with its innocent, unspoilt feel, great people, history, food, drink,
and nightlife.  Yet I came across an unexpected poignant surprise which
left a lump in my throat.  There isn't much information on the Internet
about it, and most of what there is, is hard to read and / or hidden on
obscure historical websites.

That's why I created this site as part history, part memorial.
